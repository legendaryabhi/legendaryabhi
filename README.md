## Hey, I'm Abhinav 👋  
Developer • Founder • AI Infrastructure Builder  

I like building **new things** especially in AI, developer tooling, and research-driven systems.

### My journey so far

Over the years, I’ve built and experimented across **founder ecosystems, research labs, and open-source infra**:

- **OpenResearch Laboratory** at **Necrozma Labs** — Virtual Laboratory using julia language. 
- **CodeAtoms** — Dev tools Markeptlace   

Each project taught me one thing:  
**tools shape how people think, build, and collaborate**.

### What I’m building now

- **CrewBench** — a desktop UI & control layer for AI coding agents  
  - Multi-agent orchestration  
  - Observability & guardrails  
  - Developer-first, local-first execution  

- **CodeAtoms** — evolving into a space for advanced AI & developer experimentation

### Tech I work with

- Languages: TypeScript, Python, JavaScript  
- Systems: Electron, Node.js, local-first architectures  
- AI: Multi-agent systems, CLI agents, model orchestration  
- Workflow: Git, open-source, research → product loops
